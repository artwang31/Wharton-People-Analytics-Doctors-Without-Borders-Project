# Wharton-People-Analytics-Competition-2020

Project Overview: To deliver lifesaving medical care in over 70 countries, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)/Doctors Without Borders 
relies on people. MSF’s global workforce is comprised of over 45,000 people working in country projects (the ‘field’) 
and headquarter (HQ) offices managed by Operational Centers.

The first steps we as a team took to better understand the movement of International Staff was 
to plot the career path from the first field assignment onwards to better understand how 
people move between assignments and roles on their way to becoming a Coordinator.

Much of the what we did as a team focused on finding how many
people move between each pool at each step in their MSF career and using this to make 
predictions about the number of MedCos grown.

** TASK **

Our task was to compose a clear, creative, compelling, and informative visualization that provided insight 
into movement and the career paths of medical coordinators from their first mission to their last and 
into key positions such as the MedCo role.

** Running Visuals on Exploratory Data Analysis **
